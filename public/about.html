        My introduction to coding took place thanks to my daughter. Knowing that
        I was looking for a new challenge, she suggested I took a look at
        SheCodes coding courses. I had always been very curious about coding and
        although I found it incredible challenging, or perhaps because I did, I
        inscribed, celebrating the feeling of now having a clue about what it'd
        be about.
        <br />
        Because of the vast experience I have in different working fields, I
        usually know something of any topic I come across. But things were
        different this time, and a subtle memory of a excursion I once enrolled
        in to the Pyramids, and ended up with a bus full of Swedish tourists,
        came to mind. It is very rare that I don't understand a word foreigners
        are saying, but this time, I not only didn't understand sounds either.
        Only one sound stuck, as I heard it many times, and apparently it meant
        "but". Does it say something about the Swedish culture? We'll discuss
        that another time. For now, SheCodes, and the free introduction course
        from the hand of Matt Delac are inspring me a lot...
